# General Assembly Project 1: Space Invaders

Goal: To create a functioning browser game using Vanilla JavaScript

Timeframe: 9 days

Technologies used:
* HTML5
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Github

Deployment: 
This game has been deployed on GitHub Pages and can be found here: abigailforeman1.github.io/sei-project-1/

Getting started: 
Use the clone button to download the game source code. Open the index.html file in your browser and the game should start, if not check the console for any issues.

Brief: 
Space Invaders is a classic arcade game from the 80s. The player’s aim is to shoot an invading alien armada, before it reaches the planet's surface, and to achieve the highest score possible before either being destroyed by the aliens, or allowing them to reach the planet's surface.

This was my first project while on General Assembly’s SEI course and also my first project building with Javascript.
